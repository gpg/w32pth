                                W32PTH
                  An emulation of PTH for MS Windows
                 ------------------------------------

This is an emulation of GNU PTH for MS Windows (W32).  It works by
blocking all threads when outside of one of the pth functions and
using standard W32 threads and suncronization mechanisms to emulate
the behaviour of PTH.

It is currently limited to what GnuPG 2.0 requires.


Thisng we need to implement:

  pth_select_ev - EV is currently ignored.
