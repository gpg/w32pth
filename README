                                W32PTH
                  An emulation of PTH for MS Windows
                 ------------------------------------

This is an emulation of GNU PTH for MS Windows (W32).  It works by
blocking all threads when outside of one of the pth functions and
using standard W32 threads and suncronization mechanisms to emulate
the behaviour of PTH.

It is currently limited to what GnuPG 2.0 requires.


Missing stuff:

  PTH_MODE_STATIC is known but ignored.
  PTH_MODE_REUSE
  PTH_MODE_CHAIN

  rwlock - currently just a mutex

  as well as many more things.
