* pth_waitpid should be implemented for dirmngr, at least for the
  non-blocking case.

* The whole wait stuff needs to be cleaned up.  In particular, it is 
  vital that it is clarified which events get reset before pth_wait 
  returns and which are not.  Tentatively I think that none should be 
  reset when returning from pth_wait, but we need to verify that this is 
  correct for the signal events.

* Speaking of signals, that needs to be properly implemented and 
  tested.

* Dirmngr still leaks some events under load.  Find out if this is a
  bug in dirmngr or in w32pth or a combination of both.
