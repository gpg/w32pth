* pth_waitpid should be implemented for dirmngr, at least for the
  non-blocking case.

* The whole wait stuff needs to be cleaned up.  In particular, it is 
  vital that it is clarified which events get reset before pth_wait 
  returns and which are not.  Tentatively I think that none should be 
  reset when returning from pth_wait, but we need to verify that this is 
  correct for the signal events.

* Speaking of signals, that needs to be properly implemented and 
  tested.

* We can support static initializers for mutexes, because we can check
  the initialization flag (or some other marker, like invalid handle)
  before we call enter_pth.
